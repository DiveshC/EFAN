			<h2>About us</h2>
			<p>Mama Irene Latigo Odida is a Guidance Counsellor at Turner Fenton Secondary School in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. Since 2006, Mama Latigo (as she is commonly called) has been promoting Experiential Learning to her students by taking them on hands-on humanitarian trips to Africa; Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. On one of her travels to Uganda in 2010, she was introduced to the community of Olwiyo Faith School and Orphanage in Northern Uganda by the then member of parliament for the region Hon. Richard Todwong.

			Olwiyo Faith School was founded in 2010 by Walter Okumu to provide Education to the 221 children in the village, orphaned by the 25 year civil war in Northern Uganda and various illnesses such as HIV/Aids, Ebola, and Malaria. Other than the school land that Walter Okumu donated,  the Orphanage school had nothing; there were no buildings, facilities or resources. The children, ranging from the age of 3 to 12, studied under trees and with no hygiene facilities.

			Mama Latigo and her students were so moved by the high level of poverty and need, that they raised $4000 to build four latrines and some temporary structures for the school. Unfortunately, one of the temporary structures burned down, as it was made of dirt and dry grass.
			In 2014 Mama Latigo approached Kubra Khandwala, President KIREA charity, who offered to build a Kitchen/Dinning for the school. KIREA began construction in March 2015. The Kitchen/Dinning has already been roofed. Construction is scheduled to finish July 2015.
			With any construction project, the one thing that is absolutely vital, is water. The builders of the Kitchen/Dinning facility laboured unnecessarily to fetch water from miles away. There is therefore dire need to build a borehole or well before proceeding with other projects such as classrooms, office/staffroom, playground, staff quarters and eventually dormitories for the children who are currently being fostered within the community.</p>
